## About The Automation Framework

* Used **Playwright** with **TypeScript** and integrated **Cucumber** **BDD framework**.
* Followed **Page Object Model (POM)** to organize pages, locators, and interaction methods in same class.
* Adopted **[BDD Declarative format](https://cucumber.io/docs/bdd/better-gherkin/)**, making steps concise, readable, and understandable for non-developers. Thus, minimized steps by combining input and click events into declarative statements.

### Built With

* [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)
* [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/)

  Gherkin Good BDD. @Before and @after annotations for tear down once run
* Typescript

  makes type mandy for the variables. no unwanted surprises

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and import the project in your preferred IDE.

### Prerequisites

* [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs) v18+

  *Set the node path in Environment variables.*
* Open terminal in IDE, and run ***npm i*** or ***npm install***

  *This will download all the dependencies mentioned in package.json*

## To execute Automation

After setting up the project, open terminal(command prompt)

### __Executes ALL Scenarios:__

Runs all scenarios in all feature files

***npm run test***  (bydefault runs on Chrome browser and Device as ‘Desktop Chrome’)

***npm run test --device=desktop-edge --browserName=msedge***

***npm run test --device=safari --browserName=webkit***

note: hooks.ts file has all available devices that has been configured and can be passed as params in cli.

### __Executes SPECIFIC Scenarios:__

Runs scenarios where @wip is present either at feature or scenario level

Add @wip tag and run following command

*npm run debug*

### __Generate HTML reports:__

*npm run report*

note: package.json file has all available scripts

## Automation report

3 types of reports has been configured:

* cucumber.js (generated by cucumber framework)
* html (cucumber-html-formatter helps in creating html report from .json)
* recording \*.webm (video recording of scenarios executed. This can be further converted to .mp4 format by using external lib)

Bydefault screenshot and recordVideo is set to true which can be set as false in cucumber.js

### Sample Automation report:

*note: Screenshots are set as full-page so tool will scroll and take screenshot.*

__Eligibility section and Contact details section:__

HTML: <a href="https://github.com/PriyankaPoojari/qa-bgp-ui-automation/blob/master/projectInfo/EligibiltyAndContactDetailsReport.html"> Eligibilty and ContactDetails report</a>

__New Grant Submission:__

<video width="640" height="360" controls><source src="./projectInfo/EndToEndSubmission.webm">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>

```
 HTML: [New Grant Submission report](./projectInfo/EndToEndSubmission.html)

 Video: [New Grant Submission video](./projectInfo/EndToEndSubmission.webm)
```

## Framework folder structure:

Folder structure is quite simple and organized to avoid conflicts between modules and developers.

<img src="projectInfo/FolderStructure.jpg" alt="Logo" width="400" height="900">


1. config - contains browser level global configuration
2. node_modules - contains dependencies downloaded
3. projectInfo - dummy folder to save images and reports for readme. can be ignored.
4. recordings - contains .webm file generated by playwright when recordVideo is set to TRUE
5. reports - contains .html reports of tests
6. src

   6\.1 features - contains .features file created for UserStory.

   6\.2 fixtures - contains all testdata.json which is required to run the test.

   6\.3 pages - every page is application should have its corresponding page here containing locators and methods to interact with locators. Due to limitation of time, I havent created individual page after contact section.

   6\.4 step-definitions - contains all Given, When, Then step methods which calls methods defined in pages.
7. Utils - contains all utility that can be used throughtout project like encryption.ts to encrypt passwords.

## Challenge Coverage:

Refer to “Tech Challenge Status.docx”  for the information on scenarios covered in automation. expect() method has been used to validate various checkpoints mentioned in acceptance criteria.

Due to limited time, I was able to finish End to End submission of Grant by filling mandatory fields and validate the refID in dashboard.
